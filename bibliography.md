## Shoulder kinematics after stroke with musical cueing

Title: Patterns of enhancement in paretic shoulder kinematics after stroke with musical cueing.

They experimented with shoulder rehabilitation with music feedback. The movement was guided by an ascending/sustaining/descending melody. 

Those patients with the musical feedback moved with more range and performed better than the ones without sound.
