# Sound Feedback as Performance Enhacement

Can adaptative sound feedback be used to improve performance or reduce frustration in increementally difficult tasks?

## Meeting with Martina (11/12/2020)

Example: a task where a user plays a virtual musical instrument. At the begining, when the user hasn't yet acquired the correct abilities, they will play the instrument the wrong way. 

However, they could listen to audio feedback like they are playing the correct notes in the correct time and gradually, when the difficulty increases, slowly reduce this tolerance to failure and start playing the incorrect notes.

Focus in one or multiple impairment/field (memory, spatial awareness, attention, emotion)?

- Pitch and movement
- Cooperation between patients?
- Music genres improve performance? Too hard to investigate.

- Grab [this](bibliography.md#shoulder-kinematics-after-stroke-with-musical-cueing) as base. How does rythm performance compare to pitch compare to rythm+pitch. Also, combining musical cueing with visually oriented virtual reality rehabilitation
- How does collaborative free performance compare to a guided activity?
