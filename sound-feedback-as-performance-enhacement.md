# Sound Feedback as Performance Enhacement

Can adaptative sound feedback be used to improve performance or reduce frustration in increementally difficult tasks?

Example: a task where a user plays a virtual musical instrument. At the begining, when the user hasn't yet acquired the correct abilities, they will play the instrument the wrong way. 

However, they could listen to audio feedback like they are playing the correct notes in the correct time and gradually, when the difficulty increases, slowly reduce this tolerance to failure and start playing the incorrect notes.

Focus in one or multiple impairment/field (memory, spatial awareness, range of movement, attention, emotion)?

Way easier to study a field where we can pick non-subjective data (angles of motion, total movement, points in a game).

I like the idea of making a task more 'difficult' by increasing the range of motion the user has to do to perform it correctly. For example, the [piano paper](bibliography.md#improving-left-spatial-neglect-through-music-scale-playing) where patients had to play a scale in a piano of different sizes.

- Pitch and movement.
- Cooperation between patients?
- Music genres improve performance? Too broad and subjective.

- Grab [this](bibliography.md#shoulder-kinematics-after-stroke-with-musical-cueing) as base. How does rythm performance compare to pitch compare to rythm+pitch. Also, combining musical cueing with visually oriented VR.

- How does a collaborative free performance compare to a guided activity?
There are benefits on [performing collaborative music in rehabilitation](bibliography.md#collaborative-music-in-rehabilitation). How does a "free jam session VR activity" compare to a guided VR activity in performance and motivation?
